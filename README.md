This is a full stack e-commerce web application that allows customers to search for products, manage shopping cart, checkout and view order history.

I developed and maintained web back end using Java Spring Boot. Designed and implemented front-end single-page application using Angular framework. Set up MySQL database on Amazon RDS.

Utilized Stripe API to process credit card payments. Implemented user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.

The Spring Boot back-end application was deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The front-end Angular application was hosted on AWS S3.
